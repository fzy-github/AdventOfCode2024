# Solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

This year let's try solve AoC while learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Setup
I've created a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) with bare minimum tools needed to compile and run solutions in Rust. 

I am using VS Code with Dev Container extensions to open the workspace inside my container and compile and run code there. 

Alternatively using prebuilt container for Rust from VSCode is also enough. Simply chnge container name in [devcontainer.json](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file to:
```
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/rust:1-1-bullseye"
```

## Running solutions

To compile code and run the program simply call `cargo run` inside directory with given day. Remember to swap contents of the `input/input.txt` file in the directory for given day to use your input.
